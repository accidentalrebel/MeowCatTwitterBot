# MeowCatTwitterBot
A Twitter Bot that sends a reply whenever someone uses the #meow hashtag.

## More Details
The script searches for any mention of the #meow hashtagon Twitter, it then replies to each tweet with a random cat message.

The bot uses the excellent browser automation tool, [iMacros](http://imacros.net/), and is intended to run with the free [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/).

The code is written in Javascript and is based on my other bot, [PhSpellCheckerTwitterBot](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/PHSpellCheckerTwitterBot). The difference is that this uses Javascript, while the latter uses Haxe.
